Here a the basic algorithum for converting any base number to a decimal number


Steps
-----

Step 1 − Determine the column and positional values of each digit (this depends on the position of the digit and the base of the number system).

Step 2 − Multiply the obtained column values by the base of the number you are converting to its positional value

Step 3 − Sum the products calculated in Step 2. The total is the equivalent value in decimal.

Example for converting (111)2 to decimal using the described algorithum above

Step 1 − Determine the column and positional values of each digit (this depends on the position of the digit and the base of the number system).

obtained column values = 1,1,1
obtained positional values = 2,1,0
1,1,1
  ↓
2,1,0 

since we are converting a binary number to decimal we will be multiplying each column value by 2 to the positional value

Step 2 − Multiply the obtained column values by the base of the number you are converting to its positional value

(1*2^2) + (1*2^1) + (1*2^0) = 4 + 3 + 0

Step 3 − Sum the products calculated in Step 2. The total is the equivalent value in decimal.
4 + 3 + 0 = 7

so the final answer for converting (111)2 to decimal using the described algorithum above is 7
