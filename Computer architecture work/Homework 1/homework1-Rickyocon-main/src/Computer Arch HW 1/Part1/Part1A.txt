Here is a basic algorithum for converting a decimal number to a different base 


Steps
-----

Step 1 − Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base.

Step 2 − Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit (least significant digit) of new base number.

Step 3 − Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.

Step 4 − Record the remainder from Step 3 as the next digit (to the left) of the new base number.

step 5 - Repeat Steps 3 and 4, getting remainders from right to left, until the quotient becomes zero in Step 3

*As mentioned in Steps 2 and 4, the remainders have to be arranged in the reverse order so that the first remainder 
becomes the Least Significant Digit (LSD) and the last remainder becomes the Most Significant Digit (MSD).*

Example for converting (24)10 to binary using the described algorithum above

step 1: Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base-

So in this case we are converting (24)10 to binary which is base 2. So we divide 24 by 2

Step 2: Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base and Get the quotient and remainder

24 / 2 = 12 with a remainder of 0

Step 3 − Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base and repeat step 2

24 / 2 = 12 with a remainder of 0
12 / 2 = 6 with a remainder of 0

Step 4 − Record the remainder from Step 3 as the next digit (to the left) of the new base number. 

so for our decimal number in binary is 00

step 5 - Repeat Steps 3 and 4, getting remainders from right to left, until the quotient becomes zero in Step 3

24 / 2 = 12 with a remainder of 0
12 / 2 = 6 with a remainder of 0
6 / 2 = 3 with a remainder of 0
3 / 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1
1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1

so our final answer for converting (24)10 to binary using the described algorithum above would be: 11000
